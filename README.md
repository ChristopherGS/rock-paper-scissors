Questions:

- What is wrong with our file reading technique? What should we do instead?
- How do we fix the FileNotFoundError when we run the game?
- How can we run the main file?
- How can we update the Player class to automatically generate a name so we don't have to pass one?
- How can we make the imports shorter from `name_generator.py`
- Update test to work
- How could we convert this to use a CLI / take user input?
